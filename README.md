## Starsector AUR Package

Starsector (formerly Starfarer) is a top-down space combat game, currently in
development by Fractal Softworks.

You can purchase the game from their [website](http://fractalsoftworks.com).

This repository hosts the scripts and metadata necessary to package the game so
that it can be installed by the Arch Linux package manager (pacman).
